            Hello there! My name is
            <span className="font-medium text-secondary"> Md. Mehedi Hassan</span>, and I have a deep passion for coding. My journey into web development began in 2019 when I took on the challenge of building a theme for Themeforest. My hard work paid off when my theme was accepted into their marketplace. Since then, I&apos;ve developed numerous themes for various businesses within the local economy, utilizing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This experience laid a solid foundation for my deep dive into JavaScript.
